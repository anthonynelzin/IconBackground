# IconBackground

IconBackground extracts the icon from a macOS app and puts it on a colour-matched background.

## Example

IconBackground takes this app:

![](example1.jpg)

And makes this image:

![](example2.jpg)

The colour of the background is the dominant colour of the central part of the original icon. The exact tint might change on two consecutive passes, as the position of the central part is slightly shifted from launch to launch.

## Usage

	python3 icon-background.py -a <path_of_the_app>
